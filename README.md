# Shotgun ‚Äì Windows Forms Game üéØ

This repository contains my implementation of the **Shotgun** game as part of *Inl√§mningsuppgift 2* in the course **Objektorienterad programmering med C# .NET**.  
The player competes against the computer using actions **Shoot**, **Load**, **Block**, and the special **Shotgun** move.

## Extended Description
This project was created during the course *Objektorienterad programmering med C# .NET*.  
The task was to build a playable **Windows Forms (WinForms)** application where the user plays *Shotgun* against a computer opponent that picks moves randomly.

Key objectives:
- Show each player‚Äôs current bullet count clearly at all times.
- Prevent shooting unless the player has bullets (same for the computer).
- Announce the winner and allow ‚ÄúPlay Again.‚Äù
- Enable the **Shotgun** action only when the player has **‚â• 3 bullets**.
- Write clean, object-oriented C# code following the course guidelines.

All core features are implemented as required for a passing grade (G).

---

## Assignment Scope
This submission focuses on:
- A functional **WinForms UI** for interaction and status display.
- A **game engine** enforcing rules, turn results, and win conditions.
- A **simple AI** (random move selection).

Optional improvements (not required for G) are noted in the roadmap and can be added later (e.g., smarter AI).

---

## Game Rules
- **Load vs Load** ‚Üí Both players gain **+1 bullet**.  
- **Load vs Block** ‚Üí The loading player gains **+1 bullet**.  
- **Block vs Block** ‚Üí No change.  
- **Shoot vs Block** ‚Üí The shooter **loses 1 bullet**.  
- **Shoot vs Shoot** ‚Üí Both players **lose 1 bullet**.  
- **Shoot vs Load** ‚Üí **Shooter wins** the game.  
- **Shotgun (needs 3+ bullets)** ‚Üí **Instant win** (even if opponent shoots or blocks).

---

## How to Run Locally
1. **Clone** the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ShotgunGame.git

   
## Implementation Notes (OOP)

- **GameState** class to track bullets, last moves, and win state.

- **Player** abstraction for Human and Computer:

  - Human: selected via UI buttons.

  - Computer: random strategy (can be extended).

- **GameEngine** service:

  - Validates actions (e.g., cannot Shoot with 0 bullets).

  - Resolves round outcomes based on rules.

  - Exposes events/results to the UI.

- **WinForms** UI:

  - Clearly displays bullet counts and last actions.

  - Disables invalid buttons (e.g., Shoot when bullets = 0; Shotgun when bullets < 3).

  - Dialog to show winner and Play Again option.

- **Roadmap (optional):**

    - Smarter AI (avoid ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù when opponent has 0 bullets, etc.)
    - Sound effects and animations
    - Persistent high scores
